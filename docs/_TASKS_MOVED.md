# Tasks Documentation Location

**The main tasks/roadmap file has been consolidated.**

**📍 Location:** [`../tasks_todo.md`](../tasks_todo.md) (root of repository)

---

## Why the Move?

We had two separate task tracking files:
- `docs/TASKS_TODO.md` - Comprehensive PRD-based task list
- `tasks_todo.md` - Detailed email/scheduler implementation tracking

These have been merged into a single source of truth at the root level for easier maintenance and to reduce confusion.

## What's in the Merged File?

The consolidated `tasks_todo.md` includes:
- ✅ Complete email service implementation status
- ✅ Scheduler service infrastructure completion
- ✅ Background deletion job progress
- ✅ All MVP, v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2+ features from PRD
- ✅ Recent achievements and completion tracking
- ✅ Clear next steps and recommendations
