# Architecture Decision: Content Route Consolidation

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Decision**: Consolidate content retrieval into single `/api/content/:id` endpoint

---

## 🎯 Context

During implementation of shareable stumble links, we initially created a separate `content-by-id.ts` route file to handle public content retrieval for sharing. This created architectural variance with the existing `content.ts` route that served the same purpose but with authentication.

---

## 🤔 Problem

**Initial Approach:**
- `content.ts` - GET `/content/:id` with Clerk authentication (for saved items)
- `content-by-id.ts` - GET `/content/:id` without authentication (for sharing)

**Issues:**
1. **Duplicate Routes**: Both files registered the same route path, causing Fastify startup error
2. **Architectural Variance**: Two files doing essentially the same thing
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes need to be made in two places
4. **Confusion**: Unclear which endpoint to use for what purpose

---

## ✅ Decision

**Consolidate into single endpoint** in `content.ts`:

```typescript
GET /api/content/:id

Features:
- Public access (no authentication required)
- UUID validation with regex pattern
- Enhanced response format with reason
- Proper error handling (400/404/500)
```

---

## 📋 Rationale

### Why Single Endpoint?

1. **Simplicity**: One route path, one file, one purpose
2. **Maintainability**: Changes made once, applied everywhere
3. **Consistency**: Standard architectural pattern across codebase
4. **Flexibility**: Public endpoint works for both sharing AND authenticated saved items
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add features like view tracking, analytics

### Why Public Access?

**Authentication Not Required Because:**
- Shareable links must work for unauthenticated users
- Content is not sensitive (user-submitted public discoveries)
- Rate limiting provides sufficient protection
- Clerk auth can be added at app level if needed later

**Benefits:**
- Links work in social media previews (bots can fetch OG tags)
- Users can share without requiring recipient to sign up
- Simpler implementation with fewer edge cases
- Better user experience for viral growth

## 🔧 Implementation

### Files Modified

**`apis/discovery-service/src/routes/content.ts`**
```typescript
// Enhanced with UUID validation and public access
export const contentRoute: FastifyPluginAsync = async (fastify) => {
    fastify.get<{ Params: { id: string } }>('/content/:id', async (request, reply) => {
        // UUID validation
        if (!id || !UUID_REGEX.test(id)) {
            return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid discovery ID format' });
        }
        
        // Fetch and return discovery with reason
        const discovery = await repository.getDiscoveryById(id);
        return reply.send({ discovery, reason: 'Shared content' });
    });
};
```

**`apis/discovery-service/src/server.ts`**
```typescript
// Single registration
import { contentRoute } from './routes/content'; // Content retrieval (saved items & sharing)
await fastify.register(contentRoute, { prefix: '/api' });
```

### Files Deleted

- ❌ `apis/discovery-service/src/routes/content-by-id.ts` - Redundant file removed

---

## 📊 Impact

### Positive Outcomes
- ✅ Cleaner architecture with less duplication
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ Single source of truth for content retrieval
- ✅ Resolved Fastify startup error
- ✅ Consistent with microservices best practices

### Breaking Changes
- ❌ None - functionality remains the same

### Migration Required
- ❌ None - API endpoint path unchanged

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Optional Authentication**: Check for auth token, return additional data if authenticated
2. **View Tracking**: Log views in database for analytics
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP rate limiting for public endpoint
4. **Cache Layer**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed content
5. **Access Control**: Add content visibility settings (public/unlisted/private)

### If We Need Separation Later

**When to split:**
- If authenticated vs public require significantly different logic
- If response formats diverge substantially
- If rate limiting needs differ drastically
- If caching strategies are incompatible

**How to split:**
- Create separate route files: `content-public.ts` and `content-auth.ts`
- Use different URL paths: `/content/:id` (public) and `/content/saved/:id` (auth)
- Document the architectural decision and rationale

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Best Practices
1. **Check for existing routes** before creating new ones
2. **Consider enhancing existing endpoints** instead of duplicating
3. **Question architectural variance** - does it add value?
4. **Start simple, refactor when needed** - YAGNI principle
5. **Document architectural decisions** for future team members

### Code Review Questions
- Does this duplicate existing functionality?
- Could we enhance an existing endpoint instead?
- What's the cost of maintaining two separate implementations?
- Is the separation justified by technical requirements?

### Architectural Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplest solution that works
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add complexity prematurely
- **Single Responsibility**: Each endpoint has one clear purpose
