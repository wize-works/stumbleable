# Persistent Interaction State Implementation

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Feature:** Persistent Like/Skip/Save State Across Sessions

## Overview

Implemented persistent state tracking for user interactions (likes, skips, and saves) so that when users return to previously interacted content, the UI correctly reflects their previous actions.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the reaction bar buttons (like/skip/save) only showed the current session's state. If a user liked a piece of content and then encountered it again later, the like button would appear as if it hadn't been liked, even though the interaction was stored in the database.

## Solution Architecture

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New Store Method (`interaction-service/src/store.ts`)
```typescript
async getUserInteractionStates(clerkUserId: string): Promise<{
    likedIds: string[];
    skippedIds: string[];
}>
```
- Resolves Clerk user ID to internal UUID
- Fetches all content IDs that the user has liked
- Fetches all content IDs that the user has skipped
- Returns both lists for efficient initialization

#### 2. New API Endpoint (`interaction-service/src/routes/feedback.ts`)
```
GET /api/interactions/states
```
- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Returns `{ likedIds: string[], skippedIds: string[] }`
- Used for initializing frontend caches on app load

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. InteractionAPI Cache System (`lib/api-client.ts`)

**New Static Caches:**
```typescript
private static likedCache = new Set<string>();
private static skippedCache = new Set<string>();
```

**New Methods:**
```typescript
// Synchronous checks for immediate UI response
static isLiked(discoveryId: string): boolean
static isSkipped(discoveryId: string): boolean

// Fetch interaction states from backend
static async getInteractionStates(token: string)

// Initialize caches on app load
static async initializeInteractionCaches(token: string)
```

**Cache Update Logic in `recordFeedback`:**
- On 'up' (like): Add to liked cache, remove from skipped cache
- On 'unlike': Remove from liked cache
- On 'down'/'skip': Add to skipped cache, remove from liked cache
- On 'unskip': Remove from skipped cache
- Maintains mutual exclusivity automatically

#### 2. Stumble Page Updates (`app/stumble/page.tsx`)

**Initialization:**
```typescript
// Load user data effect
await InteractionAPI.initializeSavedCache(token);
await InteractionAPI.initializeInteractionCaches(token);
```

**State Updates:**
```typescript
// When loading new discovery
setIsSaved(InteractionAPI.isSaved(response.discovery.id));
setIsLiked(InteractionAPI.isLiked(response.discovery.id));
setIsSkipped(InteractionAPI.isSkipped(response.discovery.id));
```

**Removed Local Refs:**
- Removed `likedIdsRef` and `skippedIdsRef`
- Now using centralized InteractionAPI cache instead
- Ensures consistency across all pages and components

#### 3. ReactionBar Component (`components/reaction-bar.tsx`)

Already updated to accept and display `isLiked` and `isSkipped` props:
- Like button: Filled green when liked, outline when not
- Skip button: Filled red when skipped, outline when not
- Save button: Filled yellow when saved, outline when not

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Load:**
   - User authenticates
   - App fetches all user's likes and skips from backend
   - Caches are populated with content IDs
   - Total: ~2 API calls on app initialization

2. **Stumbling:**
   - Each new discovery checks the local cache
   - Button states reflect cached values instantly (no API call)
   - Zero latency for state reflection

3. **Interaction:**
   - User clicks like/skip/save
   - Backend records/removes interaction
   - Local cache updates immediately
   - UI reflects change instantly

4. **Revisiting Content:**
   - User encounters previously liked/skipped content
   - Button automatically shows correct state from cache
   - Consistent experience across sessions

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Cache Strategy
- **One-time fetch**: Interaction states loaded once on app initialization
- **Local checks**: `isLiked()` and `isSkipped()` are synchronous
- **Automatic updates**: Caches stay in sync via `recordFeedback()`
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores content IDs, not full objects

### API Call Optimization
```
Traditional approach (per discovery):
- Check if liked: 1 API call
- Check if skipped: 1 API call
= 2 API calls per discovery × N discoveries = 2N calls

Our approach:
- Initialize once: 1 API call
- Check all discoveries: 0 additional calls
= 1 API call total
```

### Scalability
For a user with 10,000 interactions:
- Cache size: ~10,000 strings × ~36 bytes = ~360KB memory
- Lookup time: O(1) with Set data structure
- Negligible impact on performance

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Like content, refresh page → still shows as liked
- [x] Skip content, refresh page → still shows as skipped
- [x] Save content, refresh page → still shows as saved
- [x] Like then skip → skip shows, like removed
- [x] Skip then like → like shows, skip removed
- [x] Unlike previously liked content → outline state
- [x] Unskip previously skipped content → outline state
- [x] Cache persists across page navigation
- [x] No duplicate key errors on repeat interactions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
   - Consider TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries
   - Refresh stale data after X hours/days

2. **Partial Cache Updates:**
   - Instead of full fetch, could use incremental updates
   - Sync only new interactions since last fetch

3. **Offline Support:**
   - Store cache in localStorage/IndexedDB
   - Persist across browser sessions
   - Sync when back online

4. **Analytics Integration:**
   - Track cache hit rate
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Optimize based on user behavior patterns

## Implementation Notes

- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Backward compatible**: Works with existing database schema
- **Type safe**: Full TypeScript coverage with no errors
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to empty cache on failure
- **Logging**: Console logs for debugging cache initialization
