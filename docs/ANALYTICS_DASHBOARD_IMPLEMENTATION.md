## Data Sources

The analytics dashboard aggregates data from multiple services:

1. **User Service** (`/api/admin/analytics`)
   - Total users
   - Active users (7d, 30d)
   - New users (today, 7d, 30d)
   - Users by role (user, moderator, admin)

2. **Interaction Service** (`/api/analytics/summary`)
   - Total interactions
   - Interactions by type (up, down, save, share, skip)
   - Saved content counts

3. **Moderation Service** (`/api/admin/moderation-analytics`)
   - Pending items
   - Approved/rejected counts
   - Average review time
   - Content reports count

4. **Admin API** (`/api/admin/deletion-analytics`)
   - Deletion request statistics
   - Status breakdown (pending, completed, cancelled)

## Features

### Real-Time Data
- Dashboard fetches fresh data on mount
- Can be refreshed by navigating back to the page
- Shows loading states during data fetch
- Displays error messages if APIs fail

### Time Range Selection
- 7 days
- 30 days (default)
- 90 days
- **Note**: Currently UI only - backend filtering to be implemented

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly grid layouts
- Cards resize appropriately for different screen sizes
- DaisyUI stat components for consistent styling

### Role-Based Access Control
- Only accessible to administrators
- Checks user role via Clerk authentication
- Shows "Access Denied" message for non-admins

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if services are unavailable
- Error messages displayed to user
- Retry button on error state
- Console logging for debugging

## Calculated Metrics

### Growth Rate
```typescript
growthRate = (new30Days / (totalUsers - new30Days)) * 100
```
Shows percentage growth of user base in last 30 days.

### Approval Rate
```typescript
approvalRate = (totalApproved / (totalApproved + totalRejected)) * 100
```
Shows percentage of content approved vs rejected.

### Average Engagement Rate
```typescript
avgEngagementRate = totalInteractions / active30Days
```
Shows average number of interactions per active user.

## Navigation

Access the Analytics Dashboard:
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
2. Click "Analytics Dashboard" in Quick Actions section
3. Direct URL: `/admin/analytics`

Breadcrumb navigation:
```
Admin > Analytics
```

## Styling

- Uses DaisyUI stat components for metric cards
- Color-coded metrics:
  - **Primary**: Total users
  - **Success**: Active users
  - **Info**: Total interactions
  - **Warning**: Approval rate, moderators
  - **Error**: Rejected content, admins
- Consistent spacing with `space-y-8` for sections
- Grid layouts for responsive design
- Font Awesome icons for visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Implementation Needed
1. **Time Range Filtering**: Implement backend filtering for 7d/30d/90d ranges
2. **Top Domains**: Add endpoint for most popular domains
3. **Total Discoveries**: Add content count to discovery service
4. **Charts & Graphs**: Integrate charting library (e.g., Recharts) for time-series visualizations
5. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/PDF export for analytics reports

### Additional Metrics to Consider
1. User retention rate
2. Content discovery patterns
3. Peak usage times
4. Geographic distribution
5. Device/browser analytics
6. Referral sources
7. Session duration metrics

### Interactive Features
1. Click-through to detailed views
2. Filter by user role
3. Filter by content type
4. Date range picker with custom ranges
5. Comparison with previous periods
6. Real-time updates with WebSocket
