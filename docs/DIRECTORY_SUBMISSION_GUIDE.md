First Comment (Post immediately after launch):
Hey Product Hunt! üëã 

I'm excited to share Stumbleable with you all. After StumbleUpon shut down in 2018, I've been missing that magical feeling of discovering amazing websites with just one click.

So we built Stumbleable to bring back that joy of serendipitous discovery, but with modern improvements:

üé≤ **Wildness Control** - Tune how adventurous your discoveries get
‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Space bar to stumble, arrow keys to react
üåô **Dark Mode** - Because we know you browse late at night
üíæ **Save & Organize** - Keep your favorite finds in custom lists

The core discovery experience is free forever - no ads, no tracking, just pure exploration.

What's the most interesting website you've stumbled upon recently? I'd love to hear your stories! 

Try it out and let me know what you think: https://stumbleable.com
