## Why These 8 Topics?

### Entertainment (mass appeal)
Essential for any discovery platform - entertainment content is highly engaging and universally interesting. These topics cover the major entertainment verticals that drive engagement.

### Photography (visual discovery)
Visual content is core to discovery platforms. Beautiful, surprising images are highly shareable and drive exploration.

### Nature & Wildlife (universal appeal)
Nature content has universal appeal and consistently performs well. Distinct from niche "biology-oddities" - this is for mainstream nature appreciation.

### DIY & Making (practical inspiration)
Fills a gap in practical, hands-on content. Maker culture is huge and very discovery-oriented. People love finding new projects to try.

## Next Steps

### Content Operations
1. âœ… Topics immediately available in all interfaces

5. ðŸ”„ Monitor adoption rates for new topics

### Analytics to Track
- Topic selection rate during onboarding
- Discovery engagement by topic
- Content volume per new topic
