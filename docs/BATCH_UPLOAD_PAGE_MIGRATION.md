# Admin Batch Upload Page Migration

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Change**: Moved Batch Upload to dedicated admin page  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 Motivation

The batch upload component was previously embedded directly in the admin dashboard, making the dashboard page too cluttered. Moving it to a dedicated page provides:

1. **Better UX**: Dedicated space for instructions and CSV format guidance
2. **Cleaner Dashboard**: Admin overview stays focused on key metrics and quick actions
3. **Scalability**: Easier to add batch upload history, scheduling, and advanced features
4. **Consistency**: Matches pattern of other admin tools (moderation, analytics, sources)
