# Re-Engagement Email - Removed Unreleased Features

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Re-engagement email mentioned features not yet released to users

---

## 🔍 Problem

The re-engagement email had a "What's New on Stumbleable" section that listed:
1. ✅ Improved Discovery Algorithm (real feature)
2. ❌ **Creator Analytics** (not rolled out yet)
3. ❌ **Custom Lists** (not rolled out yet)

This could confuse returning users who would expect to see these features but can't find them.

---

## ✅ Solution

### Changed Section Title
- **Before:** "What's New on Stumbleable"
- **After:** "How Stumbleable Works"

This shifts from implying new features to explaining core functionality.

### Updated Feature List

**Removed Unreleased Features:**
- ❌ Creator Analytics
- ❌ Custom Lists

**Added Core Features That Actually Exist:**
- ✅ Smart Discovery Algorithm
- ✅ Save & Organize
- ✅ One Click, One Discovery

### New Content

```tsx
<Heading style={h2}>How Stumbleable Works</Heading>

<Section style={updatesList}>
    // 🎯 Smart Discovery Algorithm
    // Fine-tune your wildness controls to balance between 
    // familiar topics and surprising discoveries.
    
    // 🔖 Save & Organize
    // Bookmark the discoveries that resonate with you and 
    // revisit them anytime.
    
    // 🚀 One Click, One Discovery
    // No infinite feeds, no algorithms to game—just pure 
    // serendipity at your own pace.
</Section>
```

## 💡 Recommendation for Future

When new features ARE ready to roll out (Creator Analytics, Custom Lists, etc.):

1. **Create a new migration** to update the template with the actual feature
2. **Send a dedicated announcement email** to all users
3. **Update welcome emails** to include the new feature in onboarding
4. **Update re-engagement emails** to mention "Recently Added" features

**Template for Feature Announcements:**
```tsx
<Heading style={h2}>Recently Added</Heading>

<Section style={updatesList}>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>📊 Creator Analytics</td>
            <td>Submit content and track community engagement</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</Section>
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and ready for deployment  
**Priority:** Medium - Improves user trust and clarity  
**Risk:** None - Only removes inaccurate information
