# Scheduler Service Dockerfile Fix

## Issue

The scheduler-service Docker build was failing during GitHub Actions deployment with the error:

```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/dist": not found
```

### Root Cause

The scheduler-service `Dockerfile` was using a **single-stage build** that tried to copy a `dist` folder from the build context:

```dockerfile
# ❌ WRONG - Single stage, expects dist to already exist
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist ./dist  # ← This fails because dist doesn't exist!
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

However, the `dist` folder is **generated by TypeScript compilation** (`npm run build`), not present in the source repository.

### Why Other Services Worked

All other API services (email, user, discovery, interaction) use a **multi-stage build** pattern:

1. **deps stage** - Installs production dependencies only
2. **builder stage** - Installs ALL dependencies and runs `npm run build` to create `dist`
3. **runner stage** - Copies `dist` from builder stage and `node_modules` from deps stage

## Solution

Updated scheduler-service Dockerfile to match the working pattern used by all other services:

### Before (Broken)
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist ./dist  # ❌ Fails - dist doesn't exist in build context
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

### After (Fixed)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Fastify TypeScript service
# Stage 1: Dependencies (production only)
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --omit=dev

# Stage 2: Builder (all dependencies including dev)
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json tsconfig.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY src ./src
RUN npm run build  # ✅ Creates dist folder

# Stage 3: Runner
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 apiuser

# Copy dependencies and built files
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist  # ✅ Copies dist from builder
COPY package*.json ./

RUN chown -R apiuser:nodejs /app
USER apiuser

EXPOSE 8080
ENV PORT=8080

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=20s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://localhost:8080/health', (r) => {process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)})"

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

## Benefits of Multi-Stage Build

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Smaller final image** - Only production dependencies included
2. **Build happens in container** - No need to commit compiled `dist` folder
3. **Consistent builds** - Same build process locally and in CI/CD
4. **Security** - Runs as non-root user
5. **Cache efficiency** - Layers can be cached independently

### 🔍 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐
│  deps stage │  → Install production node_modules
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│builder stage│  → Install all node_modules + compile TypeScript
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│ runner stage│  → Copy node_modules + dist, run as non-root
└─────────────┘
     ↓
  Final Image (only this stage is kept)
```

## Verification

### Local Build Test
```bash
cd apis/scheduler-service
docker build -t test-scheduler .
docker run -p 8080:8080 test-scheduler
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"healthy","service":"scheduler-service",...}`

### CI/CD Build
GitHub Actions will now successfully:
1. Build the Docker image with all 3 stages
2. Push to Azure Container Registry
3. Deploy to AKS cluster

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `apis/scheduler-service/Dockerfile` - Converted to multi-stage build

**Verified Consistent:**
- `apis/email-service/Dockerfile` ✅
- `apis/user-service/Dockerfile` ✅
- `apis/discovery-service/Dockerfile` ✅
- `apis/interaction-service/Dockerfile` ✅
- `apis/crawler-service/Dockerfile` ✅
- `apis/moderation-service/Dockerfile` ✅

## Architectural Consistency

All API services now follow the same Dockerfile pattern:

| Service | Multi-Stage Build | TypeScript Compilation | Non-Root User | Health Check |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| discovery-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| interaction-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| user-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| crawler-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| moderation-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| email-service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **scheduler-service** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Related Issues

This fix resolves:
- ❌ `"/dist": not found` error during Docker build
- ❌ Failed GitHub Actions deployments for scheduler-service
- ❌ Inconsistency with other service Dockerfiles

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Local Docker build succeeds
- [ ] GitHub Actions build passes
- [ ] Image pushed to ACR successfully
- [ ] Deployment to AKS completes
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Service registers jobs on startup
- [ ] No regression in other services
