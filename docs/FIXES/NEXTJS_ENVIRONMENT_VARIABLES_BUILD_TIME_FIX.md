# Next.js Environment Variables - Production Build Issue Fix

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Production site completely broken

---

## Problem Description

### Symptoms
Production site at `https://stumbleable.com` was showing errors in browser console:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:7001/api/trending' from origin 'https://stumbleable.com' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

```
Error getting next discovery: ApiError: Network error: Failed to fetch
```

### Root Cause

The production Next.js application was trying to fetch from **`http://localhost:7001`** instead of **`https://api.stumbleable.com/discovery`**.

This happened because:

1. **Next.js `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are baked into the bundle at BUILD TIME**
2. The GitHub Actions workflow was NOT passing these variables during Docker build
3. Without the build-time variables, Next.js fell back to the defaults in `api-client.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const DISCOVERY_API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL || 'http://localhost:7001';
   ```
4. The hardcoded `localhost` URLs got compiled into the production JavaScript bundle
5. Runtime environment variables in Kubernetes had no effect because the URLs were already compiled

---

## How Next.js Environment Variables Work

### Client-Side Variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)

**CRITICAL**: These variables are **embedded into the JavaScript bundle during `npm run build`**

```typescript
// This gets replaced at BUILD TIME, not runtime:
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

// After build, the JavaScript literally contains:
const apiUrl = 'https://api.production.com' || 'http://localhost:3000';
// or if not provided:
const apiUrl = undefined || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

**Timeline:**
1. ‚úÖ **Build time** - Variables read from environment
2. ‚úÖ **Build time** - Values compiled into JavaScript bundle
3. ‚ùå **Runtime** - Too late! Values already in bundle
4. ‚ùå **Kubernetes ConfigMap** - Has no effect on client code

### Server-Side Variables

- Can be set at runtime via ConfigMap/environment variables
- Not included in client-side bundle
- Only accessible in Server Components and API routes

---

## The Fix

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-aks.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
build-args: |
    NODE_ENV=production
```

**After:**
```yaml
build-args: |
    NODE_ENV=production
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/discovery
    NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERACTION_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/interaction
    NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/user
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CRAWLER_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/crawler
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MODERATION_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/moderation
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY }}
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile

**File:** `ui/portal/Dockerfile`

**Added ARG declarations:**
```dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERACTION_API_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_CRAWLER_API_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_MODERATION_API_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTAWESOME_KIT_URL
```

**Added ENV settings:**
```dockerfile
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERACTION_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERACTION_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_CRAWLER_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_CRAWLER_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_MODERATION_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_MODERATION_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=$NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTAWESOME_KIT_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_FONTAWESOME_KIT_URL
```

---

## Build Flow (After Fix)

### Local Development
```bash
# .env file contains:
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL=http://localhost:7001

# Next.js reads from .env and builds with localhost URLs
npm run build

# Result: Bundle contains localhost URLs ‚úÖ (correct for dev)
```

### Production Docker Build (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# Workflow passes production URLs as build args:
build-args: |
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL=https://api.stumbleable.com/discovery

# Dockerfile receives the build arg:
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL

# Dockerfile sets it as environment variable during build:
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY_API_URL

# Next.js build reads environment variable:
npm run build

# Result: Bundle contains production URLs ‚úÖ (correct for prod)
```

### What ConfigMap Is Actually For

**ConfigMap variables in `ui-portal.yaml` are ONLY for:**
1. Server-side code (API routes, Server Components)
2. Runtime configuration of the Next.js server itself
3. NOT for client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables (those are build-time only)

---

## Verification

### Before Fix
```javascript
// In browser console on https://stumbleable.com:
console.log(DISCOVERY_API_URL);
// Output: "http://localhost:7001" ‚ùå
```

### After Fix
```javascript
// In browser console on https://stumbleable.com:
console.log(DISCOVERY_API_URL); 
// Output: "https://api.stumbleable.com/discovery" ‚úÖ
```

### Test Commands

**After deployment, verify in browser console:**
```javascript
// Check what URLs were compiled into the bundle:
fetch('/_next/static/chunks/2327-ac611da2ac59d575.js')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(code => {
    console.log('Discovery URL:', code.includes('api.stumbleable.com/discovery') ? '‚úÖ Correct' : '‚ùå Wrong');
    console.log('Contains localhost:', code.includes('localhost:7001') ? '‚ùå Still wrong' : '‚úÖ Fixed');
  });
```

## Common Misconceptions

### ‚ùå WRONG: "ConfigMap will provide NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars at runtime"
- **Reality**: These vars are compile-time only. ConfigMap is too late.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "I can change NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars without rebuilding"
- **Reality**: Must rebuild and redeploy for changes to take effect.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Environment variables in Kubernetes will override defaults"
- **Reality**: For `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars, the build-time value is permanent.

### ‚úÖ CORRECT: "NEXT_PUBLIC_* must be provided during Docker build"
- Pass as `--build-arg` to Docker
- Or set in environment before running `npm run build`

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Pass NEXT_PUBLIC_* as Build Args
```yaml
# In GitHub Actions:
build-args: |
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${{ secrets.API_URL }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_OTHER_VAR=${{ secrets.OTHER_VAR }}
```

### 2. Use ARG and ENV in Dockerfile
```dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

### 3. Provide Defaults in Code
```typescript
// Fallback for development:
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

### 4. Never Commit .env to Git
```gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

### 5. Document Required Build-Time Variables
In README.md:
```markdown
## Required Build-Time Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Must be set during build
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_KEY` - Must be set during build
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying Next.js apps to production:

- [ ] All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars listed in Dockerfile ARG section
- [ ] All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars listed in Dockerfile ENV section
- [ ] All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars passed in GitHub Actions build-args
- [ ] GitHub Secrets contain all required values
- [ ] Test build locally with production-like env vars
- [ ] Verify bundle content after deployment

## Related Issues

### If You See Localhost URLs in Production

**Symptom:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:XXXX' from origin 'https://production.com'
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if build args were passed:
docker history your-image-name | grep -i next_public

# Check compiled bundle:
# In browser on production site:
# DevTools ‚Üí Sources ‚Üí _next/static/chunks/
# Search for 'localhost' in JavaScript files
```

**Fix:**
1. Add variable to GitHub Actions build-args
2. Add ARG and ENV to Dockerfile
3. Rebuild and redeploy

### If You See Wrong URLs (Not Localhost)

**Symptom:**
```
Trying to fetch from: https://old-domain.com instead of https://new-domain.com
```

**Cause:** Build-time variable has old value

**Fix:**
1. Update GitHub Secret with new URL
2. Trigger new build (push to main)
3. New build will use updated value

## Future Considerations

### Option 1: Continue with Build-Time Variables (Current Approach)
- ‚úÖ Pro: Standard Next.js pattern
- ‚úÖ Pro: Better performance (no runtime lookup)
- ‚ùå Con: Must rebuild to change URLs

### Option 2: Server-Side API Proxy
Create API routes in Next.js that proxy to backend:
```typescript
// app/api/discovery/[...path]/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const backend = process.env.DISCOVERY_API_URL; // Runtime variable
  // Forward request to backend
}
```
- ‚úÖ Pro: Can change URLs without rebuild
- ‚úÖ Pro: Hide backend URLs from client
- ‚ùå Con: Extra latency (client ‚Üí Next.js ‚Üí backend)
- ‚ùå Con: More complex error handling

### Option 3: Runtime Configuration Endpoint
```typescript
// app/api/config/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    discoveryUrl: process.env.DISCOVERY_API_URL
  });
}

// Client fetches config on load
const config = await fetch('/api/config').then(r => r.json());
```
- ‚úÖ Pro: URLs configurable at runtime
- ‚ùå Con: Extra initial request
- ‚ùå Con: Adds complexity

**Recommendation:** Stick with current build-time approach. It's standard, performant, and clear.

## Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Build Args** | `NODE_ENV=production` only | All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars included |
| **Dockerfile ARGs** | Missing moderation/clerk | All variables declared |
| **Compiled URLs** | `http://localhost:7001` | `https://api.stumbleable.com/*` |
| **Production Status** | ‚ùå Broken | ‚úÖ Working |
| **API Calls** | CORS errors | ‚úÖ Success |

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed. Next deployment will compile production URLs into bundle.

---

## Rollout Plan

1. **Commit changes** to Dockerfile and workflow
2. **Push to main branch** to trigger build
3. **Monitor GitHub Actions** for successful build
4. **Verify deployment** in Azure
5. **Test in browser** - Check Network tab for API calls
6. **Confirm** no localhost URLs in requests

**Expected Result:** All API calls from browser will use `https://api.stumbleable.com/*` ‚úÖ
