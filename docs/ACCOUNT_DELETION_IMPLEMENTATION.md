# Account Deletion System Implementation

## Overview
Complete account deletion system with 30-day grace period, GDPR/CCPA compliance, and proper data lifecycle management.

## Implementation Date
October 2, 2025

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Database Schema

**New Table: `deletion_requests`**
- Tracks all deletion requests with status and timestamps
- Enforces 30-day grace period automatically
- Links to users table via foreign key

**Columns:**
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `clerk_user_id` - Reference to user's Clerk ID
- `user_email` - Email for notifications
- `requested_at` - When deletion was requested
- `scheduled_deletion_at` - Auto-calculated (requested_at + 30 days)
- `status` - `pending` | `cancelled` | `completed`
- `cancellation_reason` - Why user cancelled (if applicable)
- `cancelled_at` - When cancellation occurred
- `completed_at` - When deletion was finalized
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Users Table Updates:**
- `deleted_at` - Soft delete timestamp (account deactivated)
- `deletion_request_id` - Links to deletion_requests table

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_deletion_requests_clerk_user_id` - Fast user lookups
- `idx_deletion_requests_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_deletion_requests_scheduled` - Find pending deletions to process
- `idx_users_deleted_at` - Query soft-deleted accounts

### ✅ 2. Backend API Endpoints

**User Service (`/api/users/:userId/...`):**

#### POST `/deletion-request`
Request account deletion
- **Auth Required:** Yes (Clerk JWT)
- **Request:** None
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "deletionRequest": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "requestedAt": "2025-10-02T10:00:00Z",
      "scheduledDeletionAt": "2025-11-01T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    "message": "Account deletion scheduled. You have 30 days to cancel this request."
  }
  ```
- **Side Effects:**
  - Creates deletion_requests record
  - Soft deletes user (sets deleted_at timestamp)
  - Account immediately deactivated

#### POST `/cancel-deletion`
Cancel deletion request and restore account
- **Auth Required:** Yes (Clerk JWT)
- **Request:** None
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Account deletion cancelled successfully. Your account has been restored.",
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "preferredTopics": [...],
      "wildness": 50,
      "guidelinesAcceptedAt": "..."
    }
  }
  ```
- **Side Effects:**
  - Updates deletion_requests status to `cancelled`
  - Removes soft delete (clears deleted_at)
  - Account fully restored

#### GET `/deletion-request`
Get current deletion status
- **Auth Required:** Yes (Clerk JWT)
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "deletionRequest": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "requestedAt": "2025-10-02T10:00:00Z",
      "scheduledDeletionAt": "2025-11-01T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Returns 404** if no active deletion request

### ✅ 3. Repository Methods

**UserRepository new methods:**

```typescript
// Create deletion request (30-day countdown starts)
async createDeletionRequest(clerkUserId: string, userEmail: string): Promise<DeletionRequest>

// Soft delete user (deactivate but keep data)
async softDeleteUser(clerkUserId: string, deletionRequestId: string): Promise<boolean>

// Cancel deletion and restore account
async cancelDeletionRequest(clerkUserId: string): Promise<User | null>

// Get active deletion request for user
async getDeletionRequest(clerkUserId: string): Promise<DeletionRequest | null>

// Get all pending deletions (for background job)
async getPendingDeletions(): Promise<DeletionRequest[]>

// Complete deletion (hard delete - called by background job)
async completeDeletion(deletionRequestId: string): Promise<boolean>
```

### ✅ 4. Frontend Integration

**API Client (`lib/api-client.ts`):**

```typescript
// Request account deletion
UserAPI.requestDeletion(userId: string, token: string): Promise<{...}>

// Cancel deletion request
UserAPI.cancelDeletion(userId: string, token: string): Promise<{...}>

// Get deletion status
UserAPI.getDeletionStatus(userId: string, token: string): Promise<{...} | null>
```

**Data Deletion Page (`/data-deletion`):**
- Connected to real API (no longer placeholder)
- Two-step confirmation process
- Type "DELETE MY ACCOUNT" to confirm
- Calls `UserAPI.requestDeletion()`
- Signs user out after successful request
- Shows toast notification
- Proper error handling

### ✅ 5. Dashboard Enhancement

## User Flow

### Deletion Request Flow
```
1. User visits /data-deletion
2. Reads information about what gets deleted
3. Considers alternatives (export, deactivate, etc.)
4. Clicks "Yes, Delete My Account"
5. Types "DELETE MY ACCOUNT" to confirm
6. System creates deletion_request record
7. System soft-deletes user (deleted_at = NOW())
8. User signed out immediately
9. Account deactivated (cannot sign in)
10. 30-day countdown begins
```

### Grace Period Recovery Flow
```
1. User contacts support within 30 days
2. Support team verifies identity
3. Calls POST /users/:userId/cancel-deletion
4. System updates deletion_request (status = 'cancelled')
5. System clears deleted_at on user
6. Account fully restored
7. User can sign in again
```

### Permanent Deletion Flow (Background Job)
```
1. Background job runs daily
2. Queries pending deletions where scheduled_deletion_at <= NOW()
3. For each deletion:
   a. Hard delete user from users table
   b. Cascade deletes preferences (foreign key)
   c. Delete from interactions table
   d. Delete from discoveries table
   e. Delete from lists and list_items
   f. Update deletion_request (status = 'completed')
4. Log completion for audit trail
```

## Legal Compliance

- Reasonable timeframe (30 days)
- Exceptions handled (legal obligations)

✅ **Article 20 - Right to Data Portability**
- Export in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV)
- Available on-demand via `/data-export`

✅ **Article 15 - Right of Access**
- Users can see their data
- Export functionality provides full access

### CCPA (California)
✅ **Section 1798.105 - Right to Delete**
- Consumers can request deletion
- Business must delete upon request
- Exceptions documented

✅ **Section 1798.110 - Right to Know**

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Soft delete prevents accidental data loss
- 30-day grace period balances user safety with compliance
- Hard delete after grace period ensures true erasure

### Authentication
- All deletion endpoints require Clerk JWT
- User can only delete their own account
- No admin override without proper authorization

### Audit Trail
- All deletion requests logged in database
- Status changes tracked with timestamps
- Reason for cancellation captured
