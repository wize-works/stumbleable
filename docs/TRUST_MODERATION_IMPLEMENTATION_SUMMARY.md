# Trust-Based Moderation Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The balanced trust-based moderation system has been successfully implemented across the Stumbleable platform.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer (Migration `009_add_user_trust_tracking.sql`)
- ✅ Added `trust_level` column to users table (DECIMAL 0-1, default 0.50)
- ✅ Added `submissions_approved` counter
- ✅ Added `submissions_rejected` counter
- ✅ Created `calculate_user_trust()` function with volume bonus
- ✅ Created `increment_user_submission_count()` function
- ✅ Added database trigger to auto-update trust on moderation review
- ✅ Initialized existing users to neutral trust (0.50)

### 2. Moderation Service Updates

**Discovery Service (`apis/discovery-service/src/lib/moderation.ts`)**:
- ✅ Added `getSubmitterTrustLevel()` method
- ✅ Updated `moderateContent()` with trust-based logic
- ✅ Calculates combined trust score (60% user, 40% domain)
- ✅ Three-tier decision system:
  - 0.80+ → Auto-approve
  - 0.50-0.79 → Review queue
  - <0.50 → Review with scrutiny
- ✅ High trust can override medium spam concerns

**Crawler Service (`apis/crawler-service/src/lib/moderation.ts`)**:
- ✅ Identical trust-based logic as discovery service
- ✅ Ensures consistent moderation across all submission points

**Moderation Service (`apis/moderation-service/src/lib/repository.ts`)**:
- ✅ Updated `listModerationQueue()` to join user trust data
- ✅ Updated `reviewContent()` to create discoveries on approval
- ✅ Added `createDiscoveryFromQueueItem()` helper
- ✅ Added `classifyContent()` for automatic topic assignment

### 3. Frontend UI Updates

**Type Definitions (`ui/portal/lib/api-client.ts`)**:
- ✅ Added trust fields to `ModerationQueueItem` interface
- ✅ Added `trust_level`, `submissions_approved`, `submissions_rejected` to user info
- ✅ Added `trust_score` and `domain_score` to queue items

**Moderation Queue UI (`ui/portal/components/moderation-queue-tab.tsx`)**:
- ✅ Displays submitter trust level with color coding:
  - Green (≥80%): High trust
  - Yellow (50-79%): Medium trust
  - Red (<50%): Low trust
- ✅ Shows submission history (approved/rejected counts)
- ✅ Displays combined trust score with interpretation
- ✅ Shows domain reputation score
- ✅ Visual indicators help moderators make informed decisions

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created `CONTENT_MODERATION_ANALYSIS.md` (detailed analysis)
- ✅ Created `TRUST_MODERATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (step-by-step testing)
- ✅ This summary document

## 🔄 How It Works

### Submission Flow

```
1. User submits content
   ↓
2. System checks safety (NSFW, violence)
   → UNSAFE? → ❌ Reject immediately
   ↓
3. System checks spam (high confidence)
   → HIGH SPAM? → ❌ Reject immediately
   ↓
4. System fetches user trust level from database
   ↓
5. System fetches domain reputation
   ↓
6. Calculate combined trust: (user * 0.6) + (domain * 0.4)
   ↓
7. Make decision based on trust:
   - 0.80+ → ✅ Auto-approve, create discovery
   - 0.50-0.79 → ⚠️ Send to moderation queue
   - <0.50 → ⚠️ Send to queue with "low-trust" flag
```

### Moderation Review Flow

```
1. Moderator views queue item
   → Sees trust level, history, issues
   ↓
2. Moderator clicks Approve or Reject
   ↓
3. Database trigger fires:
   - Increments approved/rejected counter
   - Recalculates trust_level
   ↓
4. If approved:
   - Discovery created automatically
   - Content goes live immediately
   ↓
5. User's trust updated for next submission
```

### Trust Calculation

```typescript
approval_rate = submissions_approved / (submissions_approved + submissions_rejected)
volume_bonus = min(submissions_approved * 0.01, 0.20)  // Max +0.20
trust_level = approval_rate + volume_bonus
```

**Examples**:
- New user (0/0): **0.50** (neutral)
- 5 approved, 0 rejected: **1.00 + 0.05 = 1.00** (capped)
- 8 approved, 2 rejected: **0.80 + 0.08 = 0.88** ✅ Auto-approve
- 3 approved, 7 rejected: **0.30 + 0.03 = 0.33** ⚠️ Low trust

## 📊 Trust Thresholds

| Level | Range | Behavior | Badge Color |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **High** | 0.80-1.00 | Auto-approve | 🟢 Green |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Moderation queue | 🟡 Yellow |
| **Low** | 0.00-0.49 | Queue + extra scrutiny | 🔴 Red |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before considering this complete, test the following:

1. ✅ Database migration applies successfully
2. ⬜ New user submissions go to queue (trust = 0.50)
3. ⬜ Approving submissions increases trust
4. ⬜ Rejecting submissions decreases trust
5. ⬜ After 8-10 approvals, submissions auto-approve
6. ⬜ Moderation UI displays trust levels correctly
7. ⬜ Approved content creates discoveries automatically
8. ⬜ Database trigger updates trust on review

See `TRUST_MODERATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for detailed test scenarios.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Trust Thresholds

Edit `apis/{service}/src/lib/moderation.ts`:

```typescript
const TRUST_THRESHOLDS = {
    AUTO_APPROVE: 0.80,   // Lower = more lenient (try 0.75)
    REQUIRES_REVIEW: 0.50, // Raise = stricter queue (try 0.60)
    LIKELY_REJECT: 0.30    // Threshold for extra scrutiny
};
```

### Adjust Trust Calculation Weight

```typescript
// Current: 60% user trust, 40% domain
const combinedTrustScore = (submitterTrust * 0.6) + (domainScore * 0.4);

// Alternative: 70% user trust, 30% domain
const combinedTrustScore = (submitterTrust * 0.7) + (domainScore * 0.3);
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Recommended Metrics to Track

1. **Average Trust Level by Cohort**:
   - New users (0-5 submissions)
   - Active contributors (6-20 submissions)
   - Power users (20+ submissions)

2. **Auto-Approval Rate**: % of submissions auto-approved vs queued

3. **Queue Size Over Time**: Should decrease as trust builds

4. **Rejection Rate by Trust Level**: 
   - Do low-trust users actually submit more spam?

5. **Time to Trust**: How many approvals before reaching 0.80?

### Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Average trust by submission volume
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN (submissions_approved + submissions_rejected) = 0 THEN 'No submissions'
        WHEN (submissions_approved + submissions_rejected) <= 5 THEN '1-5 submissions'
        WHEN (submissions_approved + submissions_rejected) <= 20 THEN '6-20 submissions'
        ELSE '20+ submissions'
    END as cohort,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    AVG(trust_level) as avg_trust,
    AVG(submissions_approved::FLOAT / NULLIF(submissions_approved + submissions_rejected, 0)) as avg_approval_rate
FROM users
GROUP BY cohort;

-- Auto-approval eligibility
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE trust_level >= 0.80) as high_trust_users,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE trust_level >= 0.50 AND trust_level < 0.80) as medium_trust_users,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE trust_level < 0.50) as low_trust_users
FROM users
WHERE submissions_approved > 0 OR submissions_rejected > 0;
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Trust calculation is simple linear formula (no exponential decay)
2. No time-based trust decay (inactive users keep trust)
3. No manual trust adjustment by admins
4. Domain reputation not yet sophisticated
5. No appeal process for rejected submissions

### Future Enhancements
1. **Admin Trust Management**: UI to manually adjust user trust
2. **Trust Decay**: Reduce trust for inactive users
3. **Appeal System**: Let users contest rejections
4. **ML Spam Detection**: Replace keywords with AI model
5. **Trust Badges**: Display user trust publicly
6. **Submission Categories**: Different thresholds per category
7. **Team Reviews**: Require multiple moderator approvals for borderline cases
