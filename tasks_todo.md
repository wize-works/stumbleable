## üî• High Priority

### 1. Background Deletion Job - Automated processing after 30 days
**Status:** ‚è≥ BLOCKED - Waiting for Scheduler Service Deployment  
**Effort:** Small (remaining work: 4-6 hours)  
**Owner:** GitHub Copilot  
**Completed Work:**
- ‚úÖ Scheduler service architecture implemented (port 7007)
- ‚úÖ Hybrid approach: code-based job definitions + admin controls
- ‚úÖ Database schema: job_schedules + scheduled_jobs tables
- ‚úÖ RLS policies applied for security
- ‚úÖ Admin UI with cron editor, visual feedback, confirmations
- ‚úÖ Job registration system for services
- ‚úÖ UUID resolution fix (Clerk ID ‚Üí internal UUID)

**Description:**
Implement automated background job to process pending account deletions after the 30-day grace period expires.

**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Register deletion job in scheduler service
  - Job name: 'deletion-cleanup'
  - Cron: '0 2 * * *' (daily at 2 AM UTC)
  - Service: 'user-service'
  - Endpoint: '/api/jobs/process-deletions'
- [ ] Implement `/api/jobs/process-deletions` endpoint in user-service
  - Query deletion_requests for expired pending requests
  - Call repository.completeDeletion() for each
  - Trigger deletion-complete email
  - Log results for audit trail
- [ ] Deploy scheduler service to AKS
- [ ] Test end-to-end deletion flow

**Technical Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Scheduler Service: Fastify-based microservice managing cron jobs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Scheduler service runs on port 7007
- [x] Job registration system works
- [x] Admin UI allows enable/disable and cron editing
- [x] RLS policies protect scheduler tables

- [ ] Handles errors gracefully with retries
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows job health

**Related:**
- Depends on Email Service (#2) for deletion-complete emails
- Uses Scheduler Service infrastructure (COMPLETE)
