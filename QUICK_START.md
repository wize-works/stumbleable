# Quick Reference: What's Next?

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025  
**Current Status:** 90% MVP Complete - Ready for Production Prep

---

## 🎯 Immediate Action: Choose Your Path

### Path A: Production First (RECOMMENDED) ⭐
**Goal:** Make it bulletproof, then launch  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to public beta  
**Risk:** Low - Proven, straightforward path

```
Week 1: C9 Production Readiness (5-7 days)
Week 2: H1 Crawler Deployment (2-3 days) + Beta Prep
Week 3: Beta Launch (50-100 users)
Week 4+: Iterate based on feedback
```

**Next Command:**
```bash
# Start working on C9: Production Readiness
code ./docs/TASKS_TODO.md
```

---

### Path B: Gamification First
**Goal:** Launch with engagement hooks  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks to public beta  
**Risk:** Medium - More polish, longer timeline

```
Week 1: H3.5 Micro-Quests (3-4 days)
Week 2: C9 Production Readiness (5-7 days)
Week 3: H1 Crawler Deployment + Beta Prep
Week 4+: Beta Launch
```

---

### Path C: Fast & Furious
**Goal:** Launch ASAP, iterate fast  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to beta  
**Risk:** High - Minimal safety net

```
Week 1: C9 Essentials Only (monitoring + rate limiting)
Week 2: Beta Launch with manual content curation
Week 3+: Add features based on usage
```

## 📋 C9: Production Readiness Breakdown

### Day 1-2: Monitoring & Alerting
**Goal:** Know when things break

**Tasks:**
1. Set up error tracking
   - Option A: Sentry (recommended, free tier)
   - Option B: Datadog APM
   - Option C: New Relic

2. Configure health checks
   ```typescript
   // Add to each service
   app.get('/health', () => ({
     status: 'healthy',
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     uptime: process.uptime(),
     memory: process.memoryUsage()
   }));
   ```

3. Set up uptime monitoring
   - UptimeRobot (free, 50 monitors)
   - Pingdom
   - StatusCake

4. Configure alerts
   - Email for critical errors
   - SMS for downtime (optional)
   - Slack webhook for team notifications

**Files to Create:**
- `apis/*/src/middleware/monitoring.ts`
- `scripts/health-check-all.ts`
- `.env` entries for monitoring services

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Errors show up in dashboard within 1 minute
- ✅ Team receives alerts for downtime
- ✅ Health checks accessible at `/health` for all services

---

### Day 3-4: Rate Limiting
**Goal:** Prevent abuse and manage load

**Tasks:**
1. Install rate limiting middleware
   ```bash
   npm install @fastify/rate-limit --workspace=apis/discovery-service
   npm install @fastify/rate-limit --workspace=apis/interaction-service
   npm install @fastify/rate-limit --workspace=apis/user-service
   ```

2. Configure limits per service
   ```typescript
   // Discovery Service: 100 requests/min per IP
   await fastify.register(rateLimit, {
     max: 100,
     timeWindow: '1 minute'
   });
   
   // Interaction Service: 200 requests/min (higher for quick actions)
   // User Service: 50 requests/min (lower for profile ops)
   ```

3. Add user-specific rate limits
   ```typescript
   // Use Clerk user ID as key
   keyGenerator: (request) => {
     return request.user?.id || request.ip;
   }
   ```

4. Configure Clerk rate limits
   - Dashboard → Security → Rate Limits
   - Set sensible defaults (1000 req/min per user)

**Files to Modify:**
- `apis/*/src/server.ts` - Add rate limit middleware
- `ui/portal/middleware.ts` - Add rate limit headers

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Rate limits enforced across all services
- ✅ Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry-after
- ✅ Anonymous users have stricter limits
- ✅ Authenticated users have relaxed limits

---

### Day 5-6: Performance & Load Testing
**Goal:** Ensure it scales

**Tasks:**
1. Set up load testing
   ```bash
   npm install -g artillery
   ```

2. Create test scenarios
   ```yaml
   # artillery-test.yml
   config:
     target: 'http://localhost:3000'
     phases:
       - duration: 60
         arrivalRate: 10
         name: "Warm up"
       - duration: 300
         arrivalRate: 50
         name: "Sustained load"
   scenarios:
     - name: "Stumble flow"
       flow:
         - get:
             url: "/stumble"
         - post:
             url: "/api/discovery/next"
   ```

3. Run tests and monitor
   ```bash
   artillery run artillery-test.yml
   ```

4. Optimize slow queries
   - Add database indexes
   - Enable query caching
   - Add Redis if needed

**Files to Create:**
- `tests/artillery-test.yml`
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ <150ms p95 response time under load
- ✅ 5k concurrent users supported
- ✅ <1% error rate at peak load
- ✅ CPU usage <70% under load

---

### Day 7: Database & Backups
**Goal:** Don't lose data

**Tasks:**
1. Set up automated backups (Supabase Dashboard)
   - Settings → Database → Backups
   - Enable daily backups
   - Retention: 7 days

2. Test restore procedure
   - Download backup
   - Restore to test project
   - Validate data integrity

3. Document migration rollback
   ```sql
   -- Add to each migration
   -- Rollback script in comments
   -- Or create separate rollback files
   ```

4. Configure connection pooling
   ```typescript
   // Increase pool size for production
   const supabase = createClient(url, key, {
     db: {
       poolSize: 20
     }
   });
   ```

**Files to Create:**
- `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md`
- `database/rollback/` directory

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Daily backups running
- ✅ Restore tested successfully
- ✅ Rollback documented for all migrations
- ✅ Connection pooling optimized
