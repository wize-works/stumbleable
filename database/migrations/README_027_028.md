# RLS Fix Migrations - Summary

**Date Applied:** January 6, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Successfully Applied

---

## Overview

Two migrations were created and applied to fix Row Level Security (RLS) on A/B testing tables that were previously unrestricted.

---

## Migration 027: Add RLS Policies
**File:** `027_fix_rls_policies_for_ab_testing.sql`  
**Applied:** âœ… Yes (via Supabase MCP)

### What It Does
Adds comprehensive RLS policies to 4 A/B testing tables:

1. **algorithm_experiments** (4 policies)
   - Admins can view all experiments
   - Admins can create new experiments
   - Admins can update experiments
   - Services can access experiments (via service_role)

2. **user_experiment_assignments** (3 policies)
   - Users can view their own assignments
   - Services can manage all assignments
   - Admins can view all assignments

3. **experiment_metrics** (2 policies)
   - Admins can view metrics
   - Services can manage metrics

4. **experiment_events** (3 policies)
   - Users can view their own events
   - Admins can view all events
   - Services can manage events

**Total Policies Added:** 12

---

## Migration 028: Enable RLS
**Applied:** âœ… Yes (via Supabase MCP - inline SQL)

### What It Does
Enables Row Level Security on the 4 tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE algorithm_experiments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_experiment_assignments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE experiment_metrics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE experiment_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Note:** This was applied directly via Supabase MCP tool, not as a separate file.

## Verification Results

### RLS Enabled Check âœ…
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('algorithm_experiments', 'user_experiment_assignments', 
                    'experiment_metrics', 'experiment_events');
```

| Table | RLS |
|-------|-----|
| algorithm_experiments | âœ… true |
| experiment_events | âœ… true |
| experiment_metrics | âœ… true |
| user_experiment_assignments | âœ… true |

### Policy Count Check âœ…
```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('algorithm_experiments', 'user_experiment_assignments', 
                    'experiment_metrics', 'experiment_events')
GROUP BY tablename;
```

| Table | Policies |
|-------|----------|
| algorithm_experiments | 4 |
| user_experiment_assignments | 3 |
| experiment_metrics | 2 |
| experiment_events | 3 |

### Security Advisor Check âœ…
Ran `mcp_supabase_get_advisors(type: "security")` - **NO RLS warnings!**

---

## Impact

### Before
- 4 tables had **NO RLS protection**
- Any authenticated user could read/write experiment data
- Sensitive A/B test configurations were exposed

### After
- âœ… RLS enabled on all 4 tables
- âœ… 12 policies controlling access
- âœ… Admin-only experiment management
- âœ… User privacy protected (users only see their own data)
- âœ… Service role can operate normally

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **DONE:** RLS enabled and policies applied
2. ðŸ”² Test A/B testing with real admin user
3. ðŸ”² Create first experiment via admin dashboard
4. ðŸ”² Monitor policy performance in production

**Migration Status:** COMPLETE âœ…  
**Security Status:** SECURE âœ…  
**Ready for Production:** YES âœ…
